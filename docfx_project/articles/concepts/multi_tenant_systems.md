## Multi-tenant Systems (Multi-tenancy)
A tenant is a subscriber or customer of a [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) environment. A tenant can represent an individual user, a small-medium business (SMB), a government organization, a corporate, or a large enterprise. 

For E.g., we have built [OneImlx](/articles/concepts/oneimlx.md) system that provides our customers the state-of-the-art IAM system. Thus each customer is a tenant of our system. These customers will use [OneImlx](/articles/concepts/oneimlx.md) to manage authentication and authorization and provide fine-grained access management to their resources. 

A tenant is a headless entity and requires an operator, meaning upon signing up, the tenant will provide information about the tenant administrator. This tenant administrator, often referred to as tenant owner, can then log into the system and configure it based on their business needs. It includes adding users to a given tenant environment and setting up their permissions.

The software or a service provided in this model is a multi-tenant SaaS system. Each tenant consumes a single, shared system through a unified secured UX in a multi-tenant SaaS environment.
