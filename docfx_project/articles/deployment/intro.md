## Hosting
The Perpetual Intelligence's identity, collaboration, and cli platforms are hosting agnostic, meaning no hosting limitations at all. Application owners can host their server on their self-hosting environment, use our managed-hosting environment, or rely on third-party to provide a hosting environment.

## Self-Hosting
Use [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/), [dependency injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) and [options pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/options) to build a modern and secured web or mobile application, configure your server, provide your self-hosting implementations for stores and host in an environment of your choice, for e.g. Windows, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes etc.

## Managed-Hosting
Use Perpetual Intelligence's managed-hosting environment to host your server with build-in support for multi-tenant store implementations. Our managed hosting environment enables a secure plug-and-play for your app and service in minutes.

## Thrid-Party Hosting
Use third-party managed-hosting environment powered by Perpetual Intelligence's protocol abstractions.

## Deployment
Build deployment agnostic secured applications and services and then deploy the production apps and services on on-premise, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud or government cloud.
