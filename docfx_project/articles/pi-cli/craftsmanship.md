# Craftsmanship
We crafted the "pi-cli" framework to be cross-platform, hosting and deployment agnostic, and fully extendible. We believe .NET provides a rich set of DSL tools and languages,  and "pi-cli" directly supports the .NET core and NET6+ framework. Thus it is naturally the defacto standard in developing cross-platform CLI systems, apps, services, and developer tools in the entire .NET ecosystem.
