# Deployment
With pi-cli, you build deployment agnostic secured CLI terminals and services, test them in local environments and deploy the production apps and services on-premise, cloud (public, private, or government), or hybrid. You can also automate the deployment of your apps and services as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises.
