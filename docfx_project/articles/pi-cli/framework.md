# Introducing "pi-cli"
"pi-cli" is the Perpetual Intelligence's cross-platform framework for building command-line systems or CLI terminals in the .NET ecosystem. The framework makes it easy to build CLIs for your company, product, service, SaaS, or development and testing needs. Enterprises can create CLIs with few flags or advanced complex CLIs with organization commands, grouped commands, subcommands, arguments, and options.

> _**Take your app or service to the command line with Unicode support and build your front-end CLI in any language.**_

# Craftsmanship
We crafted the "pi-cli" framework to be cross-platform, hosting and deployment agnostic, and fully customizable. We strongly believe .NET provides a rich set of [DSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/about-domain-specific-languages?view=vs-2022) and [DDD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/ddd-oriented-microservice) tools and languages, and "pi-cli" directly supports the .NET core, ASP.NET Core, and NET6+ framework. Thus it is naturally the defacto standard in developing cross-platform CLI systems for your apps, services, and developer tools in the entire .NET ecosystem. It lets enterprises build ground-up CLI terminals or migrate their existing CLI apps and terminals with the modern and scalable micro-services-based architecture. 

> _**In short, if what you want to achieve is doable in the .NET ecosystem, it is possible with pi-cli.**_

# Getting Started
## Open Source
Our entire source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/perpetualintelligence/cli). It enables community collaboration, troubleshoot issues, and helps get us your feedback on the features and documentation. It also promotes a better understanding of architecture and design.

> _**See our [licensing terms](https://terms.perpetualintelligence.com/articles/licensing.html)**_.

## Learn to Use
To build a modern CLI terminal for simple use cases, a CLI terminal that handles authentication, or a CLI terminal that interacts with a complex distributed system via protected APIs, you don't have to be a microservices or distributed systems expert. But eventually, you can be :) similar to an [eventually-consistent system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/architect-microservice-container-applications/distributed-data-management). We believe in agile development and agile learning. So, pick a learning model that works for you!

### I want to create my first modern CLI and learn as I go on
- Please create an account with us at https://www.perpetualintelligence.com
- Pick a pricing plan that works for you. Our community edition is free for educational, research, and non-commercial use. You must have a commercial license to use the service in a non-educational, commercial, or production environment.
- Browse our code samples [here](https://docs.perpetualintelligence.com/articles/featured_samples.html), clone the [repo](https://github.com/perpetualintelligence/docs/tree/main/samples/tutorials)
- Set your License Key (a valid license key is required for both community and commercial licenses)
- Build, debug make changes and learn the concepts and you go on
- We cant wait to see the fantastic CLI terminals you build !

### I want to understand the concepts first
Continue reading, and we will explain all the concepts. We recommend you get familiar with the common architectural principles first as they enable our framework to be extendible, customizable, and remain scalable.
