# Introduction
"pi-cli" is the Perpetual Intelligence's cross-platform framework for building command-line systems or CLI terminals in the .NET ecosystem. Enterprises can create CLIs with few flags or advanced complex CLIs with organization commands, grouped commands, subcommands, and arguments. pi-cli makes it easy to build CLIs for your company, product, service, SaaS, or development and testing needs.

**_Take your app or service to the command line with Unicode support and build your front-end CLI in any language._**

# Craftsmanship
We crafted the "pi-cli" framework to be cross-platform, hosting and deployment agnostic, and fully customizable. We strongly believe .NET provides a rich set of [DSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/about-domain-specific-languages?view=vs-2022) and [DDD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/ddd-oriented-microservice) tools and languages, and "pi-cli" directly supports the .NET core, ASP.NET Core, and NET6+ framework. Thus it is naturally the defacto standard in developing cross-platform CLI systems for your apps, services, and developer tools in the entire .NET ecosystem. It lets enterprises build ground-up CLI applications or migrate their existing CLI apps and terminals with the modern and scalable micro-services-based architecture. In short, if what you want to achieve is doable in the .NET ecosystem, it is possible with pi-cli.

# Pre-Requistes
We assume you understand the commonly used architecture design patterns. If not, no worries. Here are some valuable links that you should be familiar with as they enable our framework to be extendible, customizable, and remain scalable.

# Architecture

# Hosting
The pi-cli framework is hosting agnostic, meaning no hosting limitations at all. Application authors can host their CLI apps, terminals or servers on their self-hosting environment, use managed-hosting environment, or rely on third-party to provide a hosting environment. You can configure your server, provide your self-hosting implementations for stores and host in an environment of your choice, for e.g. Windows, Linux, MacOS, Docker, Kubernetes etc.

# Deployment
With pi-cli you build deployment agnostic secured CLI applications and services, test them in local environments and deploy the production apps and services on-premise, cloud (public, private, or government), or hybrid. You can also automate the deployment of your apps and services as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises.
