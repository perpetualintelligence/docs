# Hosting
The pi-cli framework is hosting agnostic, meaning no hosting limitations at all. Application authors can host their CLI apps, terminals, or servers on their self-hosting environment, use a managed-hosting environment, or rely on a third party to provide a hosting environment. You can configure your server and provide your self-hosting implementations for stores and host in an environment of your choice, e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
