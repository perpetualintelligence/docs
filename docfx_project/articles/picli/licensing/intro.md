## Demo License
The demo license does not need an account, and you can use it for quick onboarding and testing the code samples on our GitHub account.

## Redistribution
Based on your purchased license and redistribution limit, you can develop your end-user products that integrate the `pi-cli` framework and redistribute the framework to your customers, but only as part of an end-user product. See our [redistribution terms](https://terms.perpetualintelligence.com/articles/redistribution.html) for more details.

> You are responsible for tracking the redistribution limit for your purchased license.

See our [pricing page](https://perpetualintelligence.com/products/terminal#pricing) for redistribution limits.
