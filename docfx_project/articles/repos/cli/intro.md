## Repo Visibility

This repository, its source, and all related assets are private. We are working on a new "ISV" license that will include access to the private source and 1 dedicated feature request per year. The ISV can use the framework to create custom CLI products. However, the ISV cannot change any namespace or rebrand the "pi-cli" framework.
