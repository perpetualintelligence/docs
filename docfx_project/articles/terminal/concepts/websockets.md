# TerminalWebSocketRouter: Conceptual Guide

The `TerminalWebSocketRouter` enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers over WebSockets, a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

## Why WebSockets?

WebSockets eliminate the overhead of HTTP for every message, making it suitable for:

- **Real-Time Web Applications**: Enables instant data exchange for chat apps, live sports updates, or collaborative editing tools.
- **Streaming Services**: Facilitates streaming of data in scenarios requiring high-frequency updates with minimal latency.

## Core Features

### Full-Duplex Communication
- Establishes a persistent connection for sending and receiving messages simultaneously, enhancing interactivity.

### Low Overhead
- Reduces communication overhead, enabling more efficient use of network resources compared to HTTP polling.

### Protocol Upgrade
- Initiated over an HTTP connection, easily integrates into existing web infrastructure.

## Use Cases

- **Financial Trading Platforms**: Streams market data to clients in real-time, enabling rapid trading decisions.
- **Online Gaming**: Supports multi-player gaming environments with high-frequency, low-latency updates.

## Getting Started

To use `TerminalWebSocketRouter`, define WebSocket endpoints, configure server details, and implement logic for handling WebSocket events like open, message, close, and error. The router manages the lifecycle of WebSocket connections and data framing.
