# Configuration

Welcome to the `OneImlx.Terminal` framework configuration guide. This section is designed to help developers understand and utilize the configuration options available within the framework, enabling the customization and optimization of terminal applications to meet specific requirements.

The `OneImlx.Terminal` framework offers a flexible and extensive configuration system, allowing developers to tailor the behavior of their applications through various settings:

- **Options**: Customize your terminal applications with a broad set of configuration options that control behavior, and functionality.
- **Services**: Integrate and configure services essential for the operation of terminal applications, such as command processing, authentication, and logging.
- **Limits**: Set and manage limits for different aspects of your application, such as command length, execution time, and resource consumption, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
- **Logging**: Configure logging levels, outputs, and formats to effectively monitor and debug applications. The framework's integration with Microsoft ILogger provides a versatile logging solution compatible with various logging frameworks like Serilog.

Each configuration category plays a critical role in shaping the behavior and capabilities of your terminal applications. By fine-tuning these settings, you can achieve the desired balance between functionality, performance, and security.
