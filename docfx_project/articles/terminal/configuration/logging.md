## Logging

The `OneImlx.Terminal` framework relies on the Microsoft ILogger framework to provide a robust and flexible logging mechanism. This allows developers to leverage the full suite of logging functionalities offered by .NET, ensuring that applications can efficiently log information, errors, and warnings. 

Developers have the flexibility to use the standard logger provided by .NET, integrate with popular logging solutions like Serilog for enhanced logging capabilities, or even implement custom logging solutions tailored to their application's specific needs. 

This approach ensures that terminal applications can maintain high levels of transparency, reliability, and control over logging activities, crucial for troubleshooting and maintaining enterprise-grade applications.
