# Applications
To use the `OneImlx.Terminal` framework, tenants must first create an `Application` in our system.

An `Application` connects a license with your end terminal app, ensuring that only authorized applications can use the `OneImlx.Terminal` framework's capabilities.

## Creating an Application
Follow these steps to create an Application:

1. Go to the [applications](https://www.consumer.perpetualintelligence.com/applications) page on our consumer portal.
2. Click the `Add Application` button.
3. Enter a display name for your application.
4. Submit, and our system will automatically generate a unique ID for your application.

## Application ID
The Application ID uniquely identifies your terminal application in our system and is crucial for generating the license file. It's safe to distribute the Application ID in your terminal code, as it's intended for public use.

## Licensing Your Application
After creating your Application and receiving the Application ID, generate a [license file](../licensing/intro.md). This license activates your terminal application, allowing access to the `OneImlx.Terminal` framework features.

## Managing Applications
Our consumer portal enables you to manage your applications easily. Create, update, or delete applications as necessary.
