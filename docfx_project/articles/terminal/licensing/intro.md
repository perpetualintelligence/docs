## License Transfer
Licenses for the `OneImlx.Terminal` framework are non-transferable across organizations and business units. This ensures that each entity utilizing the framework does so under a license agreement directly attributed to them.

### Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)
An ISV who develops end products incorporating the `OneImlx.Terminal` framework is permitted to redistribute the framework as part of their license agreement and redistribution limit. This facilitates the deployment of solutions enhanced by `OneImlx.Terminal` directly to end-users.

### Service Vendors and Organizations
In cases where a service vendor assists an organization in building an end product that includes the `OneImlx.Terminal` framework, both parties the service vendor and the organization, must possess their own separate licenses. This requirement ensures that all entities involved in the development and deployment process are appropriately licensed, aligning with the framework's terms of use.
