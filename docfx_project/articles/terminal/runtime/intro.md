# Runtime
This document outlines the runtime components of the `OneImlx.Terminal` framework.

# Hosting
The `OneImlx.Terminal` framework is hosting agnostic, meaning no hosting limitations at all. Application authors can host and run their CLI apps, terminals, or servers on their self-hosting environment, use a managed-hosting environment, or rely on a third party to provide a hosting environment.

You can configure your terminal using Dependency Injection(DI services) and options pattern to provide your self-hosting implementations for stores and host in an environment of your choice, e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.

# Deployment
With `OneImlx.Terminal` framework, build deployment agnostic secured terminals, test them in local environments and deploy the production apps and services on-premise, cloud (public, private, or government), or hybrid. You can also automate the deployment of your apps and services as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises.
