# .NET Docs

This repository contains the conceptual documentation for .NET. The [.NET documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet) is built from multiple repositories in addition to this one:

- [API reference](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs)
- [.NET Compiler Platform SDK reference](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-api-docs)

Issues and tasks for all but the API reference repository are tracked here. We have a large community using these resources. We make our best effort to respond to issues in a timely fashion. You can read more about our procedures for classifying and resolving issues in our [Issues policy](issues-policy.md) topic.

We welcome contributions to help us improve and complete the .NET docs. This is a very large repo, covering a large area. If this is your first visit, see our [labels and projects roadmap](styleguide/labels-projects.md) for help navigating the issues and projects in this repository.

To contribute, see the [Projects for .NET Community Contributors](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/projects/35) for ideas. The [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) has instructions on procedures we use.

If you're interested in helping migrate existing code that targets the .NET Framework from the [retired Code Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/teamblog/msdn-code-gallery-retired) site to .NET Core applications stored in our [samples repository](https://github.com/dotnet/samples) and downloadable from the [Samples Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse), see the [Code Gallery migration](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/projects/88) project. The code gallery samples were moved to the [Microsoft Archive](https://github.com/microsoftarchive?q=msdn-code-gallery) organization.

This project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant
to clarify expected behavior in our community.
