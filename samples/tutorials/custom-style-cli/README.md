This sample tutorial shows how to build CLI terminals with traditional key-value argument pairs. To see sample tutorials for options and flag based CLI see [github-style-cli](https://github.com/perpetualintelligence/docs/tree/main/samples/tutorials/github-style-cli) or [dotnet-style-cli](https://github.com/perpetualintelligence/docs/tree/main/samples/tutorials/dotnet-style-cli).

The "pi-cli" framework handles the entire CLI infrastructure for the .NET ecosystem,  so your focus is on building modern CLI apps and services and not the infrastructure. For more details, see our [documentation](https://docs.perpetualintelligence.com/articles/pi-cli/framework.html).
