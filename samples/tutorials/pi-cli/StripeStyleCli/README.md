This sample tutorial shows how to build CLI terminals similar to [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

The "pi-cli" framework handles the entire CLI infrastructure for the .NET ecosystem,  so your focus is on building modern CLI apps and services and not the infrastructure. For more details, see our [documentation](https://docs.perpetualintelligence.com/articles/pi-cli/framework.html).

The tutorial uses our [demo license](https://docs.perpetualintelligence.com/articles/pi-demo/intro.html). You need a commercial license for non-educational or production environments.
